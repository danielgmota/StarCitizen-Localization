Now, they keep the gen locked up, so you’ll have to hunt down the access codes first. Thankfully, they typically keep copies of the code on datapads.

Takao\nRISK ASSESSMENT: High Risk Target (Armed Support)\n\nHurston Dynamics is seeking a contractor to complete a bounty for ~mission(TargetName). This bounty has proven extremely elusive so far, but intel reports have tracked the target and a cohort of their known associates to ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nHowever, there is a strong chance that ~mission(TargetName|Last) will not risk a confrontation unless absolutely forced to. It is our recommendation that you neutralize a significant portion of the criminal’s allies first in order to draw them out. The report indicates that a large party of these hostiles are currently near the ~mission(Location).\n\nPayment will be released only after the bounty has been deemed complete.\n\n\n\n\n** The information transmitted may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

Journal_General_Hangar_Content=With your recent acquisition of a Personal Hangar, we here at Landing Services wanted to take a moment to let you know of some of the benefits that come with being a hangar owner and what you can expect when traveling away from home.\n\n* Your Personal Hangar *\n\n- For your convenience, all hangars, Personal and Public, come equipped with a Fleet Manager terminal that can be used to exchange vehicles via the lift. Please be sure to stand clear while the platform is in motion.\n- When shopping at local stores or fulfilling local contracts, all acquired goods will be stored in the area’s warehouse. All hangars, Personal and Public, have a Freight Elevator which can be used to transfer items to and from the warehouse. Note that smaller items can be accessed via the Gear Storage System.\n- As this is a private space only accessible to you and your invited guests, you can feel safe in storing your personal belongings not only within the provided warehouse storage, but in the hangar itself.\n- Your Personal Hangar is capable of accommodating any of the vehicles that were part of your fleet at the time of it being assigned but be mindful that if you acquire larger vehicles in the future, you may need to use a Public Hangar to access them.\n\n* Public Hangars *\n\n- When visiting a location away from home, or accessing vehicles that your Personal Hangar can’t accommodate, a Public Hangar will temporarily be assigned to you.\n- Be mindful upon departure, that items left inside a Public Hangar or its local warehouse will be considered abandoned and will become the property of the local landing services. \n\nCongratulations again, and we hope that you enjoy your Personal Hangar for years to come.\n

Journal_General_Wildlife_Content=Beyond the bustling cities, the Stanton system has plenty of opportunities to get up close with nature. This guide will highlight some of Stanton’s most interesting animals and where you can find them.  \n\n*WILDLIFE OF STANTON*\n\nKOPION\nOriginally from Nul V (Ashana) Kopion are fast, carnivorous animals that quickly evolve specialized traits, to thrive in differing environments, by reproducing quickly and in large litters. Without careful monitoring, the Kopion often becomes invasive. Fortunately, the horn of the Kopion is made of a unique combination of bone and naturally occurring carbon nanomaterials that, when processed, can be used to aid in bone regeneration, making it a valuable commodity to harvest.\n\nMAROK\nMarok are omnivorous birds often introduced to terraformed worlds as ecological stabilizers, due to their reliability as large predators. Marok owes their adaptability to their powerful gizzards, which secrete a substance during digestion that hardens into a large stone that helps the Marok digest their food more efficiently. These stones have unique conductive properties that make them sought-after for use in the production of microprocessors.\n\n*STATON HABITATS AND BIOMES*\nReady to go out and meet some these animals yourself? The following list of biomes will serve as a handy guide on where to begin your safari.\n\nTundras of Stanton I (microTech) \n• These vast, treeless plains are home to numerous herds of Kopion and flocks of Marok.\n\nForests of Stanton I (microTech)\n• The tall trees provide shelter and shade for the Kopion and Marok that inhabit these forests.\n\nCaves of Stanton IV (Hurston)\n• Herds of Kopion have flourished in these deep underground caverns. We recommend caution while exploring as the naturally aggressive Kopion can become dangerous when cornered in a confined space.

cfp_defend-criminals_desc_001=~Mission(location|address) is under threat of attack by outlaws and has asked for assistance. We need someone to protect them and drive away the outlaws. \n\nMake sure you stay close after their initial attack. Too often, outlaws win fights just by sending more bodies than anyone can reasonably defend against, so make sure you fight off any reinforcements before leaving the area. \n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro
cfp_defend-criminals_desc_002=The people at ~mission(location|address) have been regularly targeted by raiders who steal their supplies and are expecting another attack at any moment.\n\nThe survivors there are tough and committed, but they’re not equipped to defend themselves, so we’ve volunteered to help deal with these outlaws. When the raiders realize the outpost is being defended, they’re sure to send in even more of their forces, so you should recruit some help to fend off the waves of attackers\n.\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro
cfp_defend-criminals_desc_003=We’ve gotten a tip that ~mission(location|address) is about to be attacked by a vicious gang. The locals won’t stand a chance of defending themselves against a threat like this, so they’ve reached out to us for help.\n\nThis isn’t going to be some small raid. It sounds like this gang is going to launch an all-out attack on the outpost. If you can help, you’ll want to make sure you’ve got allies with you to hold off the reinforcements the gang will send once you fight off their initial assault.\n\nI know this is a dangerous request, but please, we need help.

Since XenoThreat has a lot of resources at their disposal, you should think about recruiting others to help you keep everyone safe.\n\nWe’re all counting on you.\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro

No amount of credits could measure up to how much good you’d be doing by stepping in.\n\nIf you’re willing and able to take on this mission, make sure to take some allies with you. XenoThreat will certainly send in stronger reinforcements once they realize they’re taking losses.\n\nWe believe in you.\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro

ea_popup_body_ModeDisclaimer_Resource,P=This game mode is a special limited test used to collect feedback on several new features being developed for the upcoming Engineering gameplay for Star Citizen's vehicles. It is not representative of the current Persistent Universe or intended final version of the game.\n \nFull details on the feature, everything included in this test and feedback focus can be found on the Spectrum link by clicking “Provide Feedback” below.\n \nNew Features:\n    - 3 Game Modes: Duel (A2 vs A2), Squadron Battle (A2 vs Gladius) and Free Flight.\n    - Fuses: Each player has fuses in their inventory. These can be used to fill empty slots in the relay or exchange broken fuses of the relays.\n    - Engineering Panel: This panel gives players an overview of the state of components and how they are connected. Here players will be warned about not sufficient power and if items are damaged and require repair. Additionally, players will see the states of the relays where warnings will be issued for missing or broken fuses.\n    - Damage done by attacking ships will now penetrate the hull and will damage ship items below. Players now can target the areas of ships where the ship components are placed.\n    - Power Management is partially present in this experimental mode where the focus is on simply turning items on and off to achieve power balance on the ship.\n    - Repair: Players have the Multitool with them to repair damaged ship items using the Salvage Repair mode. This mode will consume the RMC canister to bring back the health of your ship components.\n    - Additionally, we will use this mode as a test bed for some weapon balancing experiments. Details can be found in Spectrum.\n \nHow To Play:\n   - As part of the A2 crew you will spawn on-foot. To win, you must work together with your crew; filling the roles of Pilot, Gunners and Engineers.\n   - Access spare fuses in your inventory. Each player has a limited number of fuses, use them wisely.\n   - Use VOIP to communicate with your crew.\n \nFor this test we are interested in feedback on players’ survival times. How much longer does a fully crewed A2 survive against a fighter attack versus how long does it survive with no item maintenance. Additionally we would like to gather data on the lifetime of your ship components and the frequency of fuses breaking.\n \nAll vehicles featured in this test are non-customizable and purpose built for this test. Please give each a try and let us know what you think in the feedback threads.\n \nImportant Keybinds\nInventory: ~action(player_choice|pc_pit_inventory) \nPush to Talk (Team): ~action(player_input_optical_tracking|foip_pushtotalk)\nPush to Talk (Proximity): ~action(player_input_optical_tracking|foip_pushtotalk_proximity)

The stone has unique conductive properties that make it sought-after for use in computer chips.

p_protectandresupply_PreXeno_desc,P=Attention CDF volunteers, XenoThreat finally launched their attack against the INS-Jericho station in Stanton.\n\nThe Navy has requested CDF forces to help combat XenoThreat forces in the area and/or recover supplies from the wreckage and safely deliver them to Jericho station. \n\nThe Navy has organized a community stipend to handle the distribution of payment. This will be distributed among all CDF volunteers at assigned intervals. An indicator will appear on your HUD to measure these payouts.\n\nPlease note that the supplies are highly volatile if not handled correctly. Use caution while transporting these materials:\n* Zeta-Prolanide degrades over time until breaking down completely.\n* AcryliPlex Composite becomes explosively unstable if damaged.\n* Diluthermex releases a destructive energy pulse if exposed to quantum travel.\n\nSAIC Rowena Dulli from the Advocacy is the official attaché to the CDF and will be running the operation.

xenothreat_defend_HH_H_desc_001=Os Headhunters ainda não aprenderam seu lugar em Pyro e estão prestes a lançar um ataque completo em ~mission(location|address). Infelizmente para eles, você vai para-los. \n\nVá para lá o mais rápido possível, recrute aliados se necessário e prepare-se para neutralizar o grupo de ataque por qualquer meio necessário. Isso inclui lidar com quaisquer reforços que eles decidam lançar em seu caminho. \n\nVocê tem meu total apoio.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler\n

Suponho que eles não estarão preparados para enfrentar qualquer resistência formidável, pelo menos na primeira onda do ataque. Quaisquer reforços que eles enviarem estarão mais bem equipados, então esteja preparado. \n\nEspero que, depois de colocá-los no chão, eles finalmente aprendam a lição. \n\nComm. Spec. Engler\n
